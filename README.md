### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Data Scientist with more than five years of experience helping companies and institutions 
solving complex problems using data.

I have successfully completed projects ranging from predictive modeling to data pipelines 
designing for both enterprises and startups.

I have extensive experience using Python Data Science toolkit (pandas, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, 
Keras, PySpark, etc.) and working with large amounts of data (~GB, TB) in a daily basis, so I am 
also experienced with Big Data and distributed computing tools (Hadoop Ecosystem: Spark, Hive, 
Impala, etc.) as well as parallel computing ones (GPU accelerated computing).

In 2019 I started my own company, a Data Science consultancy called [WhiteBoxá´¹á´¸](https://whiteboxml.com).
